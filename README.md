# pyqt_analog_gauge_udp
This Python code is a PyQt5-based application for real-time data visualization and logging. It uses PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and pyqtgraph for real-time data plotting. The code appears to be part of a larger project for monitoring and visualizing data from some external source, possibly sensors or a network connection.

Here's a brief description of the key components and functionality of the code:

Imports: The code imports various modules, including PyQt5, pyqtgraph, socket for network communication, numpy for numerical operations, and csv for logging data.

Class Definition - THREADS_APP: This class represents the main application window. It sets up the GUI, including real-time plots using pyqtgraph and widgets for displaying data. It also manages threads for data collection and logging.

start_ethernet: This method initializes and starts a thread (ThreadClass) for collecting data from a UDP network connection.

run_log_csv: This method is intended to start a separate thread (LoggingThread) for logging data to a CSV file, but it seems to be commented out.

my_function: This method updates the GUI with real-time data received from the UDP network connection. It updates the plot, displays numeric values, and handles data visualization.

LoggingThread: This class represents a thread responsible for logging data to a CSV file. It writes data to the CSV file continuously.

ThreadClass: This class represents a thread that collects data from a UDP network connection. It decodes and processes data received over the network, calculates values, and emits signals to update the GUI.

Main Application: The code initializes and starts the PyQt5 application, creates an instance of the THREADS_APP class, and runs the application loop.

Overall, the code appears to be designed for real-time data visualization and logging, particularly for monitoring values such as phi, psi, d, x, y, z, and timer values received over a UDP network connection. However, there are some commented-out sections and unused variables, indicating that it may be a work in progress or require further development for complete functionality.

Please note that this code references specific UI files ('analoggaugewidget_demo3.ui') and assumes the existence of certain UI components and widgets. To fully understand and run this code, you would need access to the complete project files and resources, including the referenced UI files.
